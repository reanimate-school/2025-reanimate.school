# Andrew Hogue

Dr. Andrew Hogue is an Associate Professor at Ontario Tech University within the Faculty of Business and Information Technology's Game Development and Entrepreneurship program. His research interests include the development and evaluation of game design techniques for education, stereoscopic visualization and virtual reality. He is currently interested in understanding how environmental, technology and design parameters affect the user experience in virtual reality.  Advances in this area will undoubtedly enable developers to create better stereoscopic 3D video game content. During his Master of Science studies at York University, he developed hardware and software for immersive virtual reality displays, as well as a variety of stereoscopic 3D applications to evaluate the effectiveness of head-tracking on user immersion. He has been the driving force behind the design and development of the Game Development Lab at Ontario Tech University, ensuring it has the latest emerging technology for undergraduate and graduate student training/research. Through his past involvement in the Immersive Visual environment project at York University, he has gained interests in psychophysics, stereoscopic 3D, and determining the factors for engagement and immersion in simulation.

Dr. Hogue has supervised more than 40 undergraduates as summer research students and fourth-year Capstone projects, and five graduate (MSc/PhD) students. He has also been involved in securing more than $4 million in research funds for a variety of robotics and simulation projects. He has published more than 30 refereed journal and conference articles.

# Richy Srirachanikorn

Richy Srirachanikorn is a sociologist studying nostalgia, video games, and loneliness. Instead of viewing nostalgia as a backwards-facing obsession of things that are lost in the past, he explores how nostalgia is a forward-facing response to loss and change. Specifically, how do video games help us redefine the past we lived into the futures we had hoped to experience? What does this actualized 'lost future' do for players who share a common nostalgia for past experiences? Can nostalgia help us playfully define, and build towards, a future?
