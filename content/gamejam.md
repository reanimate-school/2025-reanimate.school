The goal of the game jam was to design and develop games in [Batari](https://bataribasic.com/) following [Andrew Hogue's benevolent guidance](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1wPLPjsltfTZ86I46uwNx60WCjgA3XqolMDP6W_nIFh0/). Participants installed VSCode and the Batari plug-in and could write, debug, test their code directly into the IDE. They produced quite amazing game 😉.
