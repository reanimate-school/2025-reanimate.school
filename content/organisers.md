# Yann-Gaël Guéhéneuc
> Full Professor, Concordia University, Canada Research Chair in Empirical Software Engineering for the IoT

Yann-Gaël Guéhéneuc has been a full professor at the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering of Concordia University since 2017, where he leads the Ptidej team in evaluating and enhancing the quality of the software systems, focusing on the Internet of Things and researching new theories, methods, and tools to understand, evaluate, and improve the development, release, testing, and security of such systems. Prior, he was a faculty member at Polytechnique Montréal and Université de Montréal, where he started as an assistant professor in 2003. In 2018, he was awarded the NSERC Research Chair Tier I on Empirical Software Engineering for the IoT. In 2013-2014, for a sabbatical year, he visited KAIST, Yonsei University, and Seoul National University, in Korea, as well as the National Institute of Informatics, in Japan. In 2014, he received the NSERC Research Chair Tier II on Patterns in Mixed-language Systems. In 2010, he became an IEEE Senior Member. In 2009, he obtained the NSERC Research Chair Tier II on Software Patterns and Patterns of Software. In 2003, he received a Ph.D. in Software Engineering from the University of Nantes, France, under Professor Pierre Cointe's supervision. His Ph.D. thesis was funded by Object Technology International, Inc. (now IBM Ottawa Labs.), where he worked in 1999 and 2000. In 1998, he graduated as an engineer from École des Mines of Nantes. His research interests are program understanding and program quality, in particular through the use and the identification of recurring patterns. He was the first to use explanation-based constraint programming in the context of software engineering to identify occurrences of patterns. He is interested also in empirical software engineering; he uses eye-trackers to understand and develop theories about program comprehension. He has published papers in international conferences and journals, including IEEE TSE, Springer EMSE, ACM/IEEE ICSE, IEEE ICSME, and IEEE SANER. He was the program co-chair and general chair of several events, including IEEE ICPC'20 and '19, SANER'15, APSEC'14, and IEEE ICSM'13. 

# Fabio Petrillo
> Associate Professor, École de Technologie Supérieure

Fabio Petrillo serves as an associate professor in the Department of Software Engineering and IT at École de Technologie Supérieure in Montreal, Canada, starting in 2022. He completed his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the Federal University of Rio Grande do Sul in Brazil in 2016. Following that, he pursued a postdoctoral fellowship at Concordia University in Canada.

# Carl Therrien
> Full Professor, Université de Montréal

Carl Therrien is a Full Professor in games and film studies at the Université de Montréal. In The Media Snatcher (Platform studies, MIT Press, 2019), he proposed  a critical view of videogame historiography through a comparative study of the PC Engine platform, confronting American and Japanese perspectives of this technology. He has written numerous papers on immersion and the history of popular genres (such as adventure games and first-person shooters). His research projects seek to integrate more video games into the canon, hoping to assist archivists and historians in their efforts to engage with the diversity and complexity of this culture.

# Cristiano Politowski
> Post-doc., Université de Montréal

Cristiano Politowski is a postdoctoral researcher working with Professor Houari Sahraoui and Professor Michalis Famelis at the GEODES Software Engineering Research Group, part of the Department of Computer Science and Operations Research (DIRO), at Université de Montréal, Montréal, Québec, Canada. Also as a postdoctoral researcher, he worked at École de Technologie Supérieure (ÉTS), working with Professor Ghizlane El Boussaidi on research related to software architecture and software requirements. He completed his Ph.D. in the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering at Concordia University in 2022. Dr. Politowski received his master's degree in Computer Science from the Universidade de Santa Maria and his undergraduate diploma in Computer Science from the Universidade Regional do Noroeste do Estado do Rio Grande do Sul, both in Brazil. Before joining academia, he gained experience in the industry, particularly in the field of web applications and web server performance.

# Nicolas Rousse
> Master's student, Concordia University

Nicolas Collins Rousse completed his bachelor degree in Electrical Engineering with a concentration in computer science at École de Technologie Supérieure in Montréal, Québec, Canada in 2018. He is currently pursuing a master’s degree (MASc) in Software Engineering at Concordia university in Montréal. He has been professionally creating embedded control system hardware and software since 2016. He also has great experience in electronic equipment repair including retro computers and gaming systems. His interests and skills include bringing new hardware and software technologies and applications to retro systems.

# Gabriel Ullmann
> Research professional, Concordia University

Gabriel C. Ullmann is a research support professional at the Next-Generation Cities Institute at Concordia University in Montreal. Currently, he is a member of the development team for CityLayers, a web-enabled smart cities simulation platform. Throughout his Master's program, his research focus centered on Game Engine Architecture, and his thesis involved a comprehensive analysis of notable game engines like Unreal, CryEngine, and Godot. His research interests also include Software Architecture Recovery, Video Game Development, and Artificial Intelligence.

# Laurent Voisard
> Master's student, Concordia University

Laurent Voisard completed his bachelor's degree in Computer Science: Computer Games Co-op program at Concordia University in 2024. He has freshly started his Master's degree (MACs) in Software Engineering at Concordia University. Laurent started his research academic path in the Summer 2023 thanks to a NSERC USRA research award, and published two AR/VR papers since then. Now, Laurent turns to study fundamental systems in video games, specifically looking at his favourite genre: Action-RPGs in the likes of the Diablo series.
