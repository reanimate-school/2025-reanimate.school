# Yann-Gaël Guéhéneuc
> Full Professor, Concordia University, Canada Research Chair in Empirical Software Engineering for the IoT

Yann-Gaël Guéhéneuc has been a full professor at the Department of Computer Science and Software Engineering of Concordia University since 2017, where he leads the Ptidej team in evaluating and enhancing the quality of the software systems, focusing on the Internet of Things and researching new theories, methods, and tools to understand, evaluate, and improve the development, release, testing, and security of such systems. Prior, he was a faculty member at Polytechnique Montréal and Université de Montréal, where he started as an assistant professor in 2003. In 2018, he was awarded the NSERC Research Chair Tier I on Empirical Software Engineering for the IoT. In 2013-2014, for a sabbatical year, he visited KAIST, Yonsei University, and Seoul National University, in Korea, as well as the National Institute of Informatics, in Japan. In 2014, he received the NSERC Research Chair Tier II on Patterns in Mixed-language Systems. In 2010, he became an IEEE Senior Member. In 2009, he obtained the NSERC Research Chair Tier II on Software Patterns and Patterns of Software. In 2003, he received a Ph.D. in Software Engineering from the University of Nantes, France, under Professor Pierre Cointe's supervision. His Ph.D. thesis was funded by Object Technology International, Inc. (now IBM Ottawa Labs.), where he worked in 1999 and 2000. In 1998, he graduated as an engineer from École des Mines of Nantes. His research interests are program understanding and program quality, in particular through the use and the identification of recurring patterns. He was the first to use explanation-based constraint programming in the context of software engineering to identify occurrences of patterns. He is interested also in empirical software engineering; he uses eye-trackers to understand and develop theories about program comprehension. He has published papers in international conferences and journals, including IEEE TSE, Springer EMSE, ACM/IEEE ICSE, IEEE ICSME, and IEEE SANER. He was the program co-chair and general chair of several events, including IEEE ICPC'20 and '19, SANER'15, APSEC'14, and IEEE ICSM'13. 

# Fabio Petrillo
